+I need to convert this code to microservices. how would you suggest it should be organised. also the kafka_trade_consumer_7.py uses asynch and multiple tasks; is this correct for microservices

+convert above code into a microservice architecture. the different services will communicate using kafka. as you write code add documentation include high level dscriptions of inputs and output
